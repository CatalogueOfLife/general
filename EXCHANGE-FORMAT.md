# Exchange format
A modified exchange format based on the previous [i4Life Darwin Core Archive Profile](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20237) that should be used to steer GSD publishing towards.
It is used as the base for ingestion of source data into the Catalogue of Life as well as for exports/downloads.

Yuri: the main question, how many GSDs will be able to follow new format. i4Life Darwin Core Archive was never used in the internal process.
