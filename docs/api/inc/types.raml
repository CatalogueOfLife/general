    Enumeration of all possible rank values across all codes.
    See http://api.col.plus/vocab/rank for the complete list in use

    There is the need to deal with old ranks not accepted anymore.
    The list given is intended to be interoperable between name providers for bacteria, viruses, fungi, plants, and animals.
    The enumeration attempts to strike a balance between listing all possible rank terms, and remaining comprehensible.
    Not included in the list are the botanical "notho-" ranks, which are used to designate hybrids (nothospecies, nothogenus) as this information is handled by the Name.notho property already.

    The enumeration is in very active development and extended as new rules are implemented.
    Not all flagged issues are highlighting data problems. Some simply flag the fact that data was modified during imports,
    for example "vernacular name transliterated" is added then a latin transliteration of a vernacular name was automatically generated.

    The status related to the latest nomenclatural act published for the name and its conformance to the rules of nomenclature.
    See http://api.col.plus/vocab/nomstatus

    Generic nomenclatural status enumeration across all codes.
    Only the broader status concepts are captured and details of the nomenclatural status of a name should be given as free text.
    The overloaded term "valid" is avoided as it carries different semantics in the botanical and zoological code.
    Rendering of the status can be different between codes and some values only apply to certain codes.

    ok
    : TODO: probably a better term should be coined
    : Botany - Names that are validly published and legitimate
    : Zoology - Available name and potentially valid, i.e. not otherwise invalid for any other objective reason, such as being a junior homonym.

    unavailable
    : Botany - Names that are not validly published (nom. inval.)
    : Zoology - An unavailable name published not conforming to all the mandatory provisions of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

    illegitimate
    : Botany - A validly published name which is a later homonym, superfluous, or rejected (nom. illeg.)
    : Zoology - Available, but objectively invalid names, e.g. junior homonym or objective synonyms

    variant
    : Orthographic variant. An alternative or corrected spelling for the name (orth. var.)

    replacement
    : A nomen novum, replacement name or new substitute name indicates a scientific name
      that is created specifically to replace another preoccupied name,
      but only when this other name can not be used for technical, nomenclatural reasons.
      It automatically inherits the same type and type locality and is commonly applied
      to names proposed to replace junior homonyms

    conserved
    : Botany - A validly published name which is listed in the ICN appendices of conserved names (nom. cons.)
    : Zoology -

    rejected
    : Botany - A validly published name listed as rejected by ICN â€“ includes utique rejiciendum and opera oppressa (nom. rej.)
    : Zoology -

    doubtful
    : Unknown or doubtful names (nom. dub.)

    unevaluated

  description: >

    See http://api.col.plus/vocab/nomreltype

     spelling correction
     : The current name is a spelling correction, called emendation in zoology, of the related name having the same type.
       Intentional changes in the original spelling of an available name, whether justified or unjustified.
       The binomial authority remains unchanged.
       Valid emendations include changes made to correct:
          a) typographical errors in the original work describing the species,
          b) errors in transliteration from non-Latin languages,
          c) names that included diacritics, hyphens
          d) endings of species to match the gender of the generic name, particularly when the combination has been changed
       
       For example, Hieronima and Hyeronima are orthographical variants of Hieronyma.
       One of the spellings must be treated as the correct one. In this case, the spelling Hieronyma has been conserved
       and is to be used as the correct spelling.
       
       Botany (Article 61).: An inadvertent use of one of the other spellings has no consequences:
       the name is to be treated as if it were correctly spelled.
       
       Zoology (Art. 32-33 ): Orthographical variants in the formal sense do not exist;
       a misspelling or orthographic error is treated as a lapsus, a form of inadvertent error.
       The first reviser is allowed to choose one variant for mandatory further use, but in other ways,
       these errors generally have no further formal standing.

     basionym
     : The current name has a basionym and therefore is either
       a recombination (combinatio nova, comb. nov.) of the name pointed to
        (and the name pointed to is not, itself, a recombination),
       or a change in rank (status novus, stat. nov.).

     based on
     : The current name is the validation of a name that was not fully published before.
       Covers the use of ex in botanical author strings.
       
       ICN Art. 46.4: e.g. if this name object represents G. tomentosum Nutt. ex Seem.
       then the related name should be G. tomentosum Nutt.

     replacement name
     : Current name is replacement for the related name.
       Also called 'Nomen Novum' or 'avowed substitute'
       ICN: Article 7.3
       ICZN: Article 60.3.

     conserved
     : The current name or spelling is conserved / protected against the related name
       or the related name is suppressed / rejected in favor of the current name.
      
       A spelling which has been conserved relates two homotypic names, otherwise
       the related names should be based on different types.
      
       Based on an individual publication but more often
       due to actions of the ICZN or ICBN exercising its Plenary Powers.
      
       ICN: Conservation is covered under Article 14 and Appendix II and Appendix III (this name is nomina conservanda).
       ICZN: Reversal of precedence under Article 23.9 (this name is nomen protectum and the target name is nomen oblitum)
             or suppression via plenary power Article 81.

     later homonym
     : Current name has same spelling as related name
       but was published later and has priority over it (unless conserved or sanctioned)
       and is based on a different type. Called a junior homonym in zoology.
       This includes botanical parahomonyms which differ slightly in spelling
       but are similar enough that they are likely to be confused (Art 53.3).
       The zoological code has a set of spelling variations (article 58) that are considered to be identical.
       When acts of conservation or suppression have occurred then the terms 'Conserved Later Homonym'and 'Rejected Earlier Homonym' should be used.
       Two identical and homotypic names (isonyms) should be indicated with the superfluous relation type.
       ICN: Article 53
       ICZN: Chapter 12, Article 52.

     superfluous
     : Current name was superfluous at its time of publication,
       i. e. it was based on the same type as the related, previously published name (ICN article 52).
       The current, superfluous name is available but illegitimate. 
       Includes the special case of isonyms which are identical names.

     homotypic
     : A relation indicating two homotypic names, i.e. objective or nomenclatural synonymy, but not further specifying why.

    A scientific name.
    CoL deals and categorizes the following types of names:

     - Linnaean names, i.e. mono-, bi- or trinomials
       - available or unavailable
     - Named hybrids and nothotaxa
     - Virus names

    A name includes it's authorship. Two homonyms with different authors therefore represent two different name entities.

    ### Lexical variations

    The same name can usually be represented by many different strings which we refer to as lexical variations.
    For each name a standard representation, the canonical form, exists.

    Lexical variations exist for various reasons.
    Author spelling, transliterations, epither gender, additional infrageneric or infraspecific indications, cited species authors in infraspecific names are common reasons.
    Listed here are 7 distinct names with some of their string representations:

    ```
     1. Aus bus Linnaeus 1758
        - Aus bus Linn. 1758
        - Aus bus Linn 1758
        - Aus bus L.
        - Aus ba Linn 1758.
        - Aus (Hus) bus L.

     2. Xus bus (Linn, 1758)
        - Xus bus (Linn) Smith

     3. Xus cus Smith, 1850
        - Xus cus Sm.

     4. Xus cus Jones 1900

     5. Xus bus cus Smith 1850
        - Xus bus subsp. cus Smith 1850

     6. Xus dus Pyle 2000

     7. Foo bar var. lion Smith 1850
        - Foo bar L. var. lion Smith
        - Foo bar subsp. dar var. lion Smith 1850
        - Foo bar Lin. subsp. dar Mill. var. lion Smith 1850
    ```

    New names (**sp./gen. nov.**),
    new recombinations of the same epithet (**comb. nov.**),
    a name at a new rank (**stat. nov.**)
    or replacement names (**nom. nov.**) are all treated as distinct names.

    ### Homotypic group & original name
    Names based on the same type can be clustered together as a homotypic group of names.
    A homotypic group not only includes all subsequent recombinations, but also any [replacement name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomen_novum) if existing.
    These names are homotypic synonyms, also called nomenclatural or objective synonyms.

    The first, originally published name is used to represent such a group as it is a clean proxy to the type specimen,
    therefore every name in a homotypic group points back to the same original name.

    Protonym in zoology and basionym in botany are terms for a very similar concept, but they do not include replacement names and are rather code specific
    so we will refer to *original name* here instead, inline with Darwin Core terminology.
    Original names are not necessarily Code-compliant original descriptions, but usually they are.

    The above names can be clustered into four sets of homotypic synonym groups, shown with canonical authorship:

    ```
     1. Aus bus Linnaeus 1758
        - Aus ba Linnaeus 1758 [orthographic variant]
        - Xus bus (Linnaeus 1758) Smith 1850 [alternate combination]

     2. Xus cus Smith 1850
        - Xus bus subsp. cus Smith 1850 [alternate rank]

     3. Xus cus Jones 1900 (heterotypic homonym of Xus cus Smith 1850)
        - Xus dus Pyle 2000 [replacement name for Xus cus Jones]

     4. Foo bar var. lion Smith 1850
    ```

    ### comb. nov. in ICZN vs ICN

    One of the most notable differences between [ICN](http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/)
    and [ICZN](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/) is the way names are cited when a species is placed in a different genus from the one it was originally published in (a comb. nov.).
    Botanists have a convention of always citing the authors of the original combination in brackets followed by the names of the authors of the combination.
    Zoologists don't follow this convention, they simply place the author of the original combination in brackets for the new combination and don't cite the authors who were first to make the new combination.
    This difference is cosmetic. Indeed [ICZN Recommendation 51G](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=51) is that new combinations in zoology should be quoted in a similar way to the way they are quoted in botany.

    *Basionym* is a well established term in the ICN where it is defined that
    a "basionym provides the final epithet, name, or stem of the new combination or name at new rank" (ICN Art. 6.10 & Art. 41).
    It is the orginal combination of a name as viewed from a new combination. The basionym is therefore always relative to a new combination.
    A name can't be a basionym in its own right only relative to another name.
    ICZN does not mention the term basionym but the notion is clearly present in zoological nomenclature as zoologists also have the concept of the new recombination of a name.

    A (literature) reference mostly given in [CSL-JSON](https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema#csl-json-schema).
    A reference can be linked to a serial, e.g. a journal, that defines the content for the CSL container attributes.

    Treatments are the section of a publication that deals with a single scientific name.
    They are a unit of citation below articles. [Plazi](http://www.plazi.org) is based on them
    and Taxon Name Usages (TNU) in [GNUB](http://globalnames.org/docs/gnub/) correspond to treatments.

    The ability to link to the treatment of a name is very useful. It is accomplished in the NameRelation class,
    but not dealt with on the shared Reference instances.

Serial:

  description: |
      A journal or other serial used as a container for references.

      A serial is a publication in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts,
      usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.
      Serial publications include print periodicals and newspapers, electronic magazines and journals, annuals (reports, yearbooks, etc.),
      proceedings and transactions, and numbered monographic series cataloged separately.

      When serials split, merge, or are absorbed, a title change may occur.

      A specific serial title is identified by a unique International Standard Serials Number (ISSN) and key title,
      assigned and maintained by the International Serials Data System (ISDS), a network of national serials data centers.
      Serials and annuals are listed in Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory published annually by ProQuest and in The Serials Directory published by EBSCO.
