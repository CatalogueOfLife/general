      Enumeration of all possible rank values across all codes.
      There is the need to deal with old ranks not accepted anymore.
      The list given is intended to be interoperable between name providers for bacteria, viruses, fungi, plants, and animals.
      The enumeration attempts to strike a balance between listing all possible rank terms, and remaining comprehensible.
      Not included in the list are the botanical "notho-" ranks, which are used to designate hybrids (nothospecies, nothogenus) as this information is handled by the Name.notho property already.

      The overloaded term "valid" is avoided as it carries different semantics in the botanical and zoological code.
      Rendering of the status can be different between codes and some values only apply to certain codes.

      ok
      : TODO: probably a better term should be coined
      : Botany - Names that are validly published and legitimate
      : Zoology - Available name and potentially valid, i.e. not otherwise invalid for any other objective reason, such as being a junior homonym.

      unavailable
      : Botany - Names that are not validly published (nom. inval.)
      : Zoology - An unavailable name published not conforming to all the mandatory provisions of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

      illegitimate
      : Botany - A validly published name which is a later homonym, superfluous, or rejected (nom. illeg.)
      : Zoology - Available, but objectively invalid names, e.g. junior homonym or objective synonyms

      variant
      : Orthographic variant. An alternative or corrected spelling for the name (orth. var.)

      replacement

        that is created specifically to replace another preoccupied name,
        but only when this other name can not be used for technical, nomenclatural reasons.
        It automatically inherits the same type and type locality and is commonly applied
        to names proposed to replace junior homonyms

RenÃ© Louiche Desfontaines launched de Candolle's botanical career by recommending him at an herbarium. Within a couple of years de Candolle had established a new genus, and he went on to document hundreds of plant families and create a new natural plant classification system. Although de Candolle's main focus was botany, he also contributed to related fields such as phytogeography, agronomy, paleontology, medical botany, and economic botany. Candolle originated the idea of Nature's war, which influenced Charles Darwin and the principle of natural selection.[1] de Candolle recognized that multiple species may develop similar characteristics that did not appear in a common evolutionary ancestor; this was later termed analogy. During his work with plants, de Candolle noticed that plant leaf movements follow a near-24-hour cycle in constant light, suggesting that an internal biological clock exists. Though many scientists doubted de Candolle's findings, experiments over a century later demonstrated that â€³the internal biological clockâ€³ indeed exists. Candolle's descendants continued his work on plant classification. Alphonse de Candolle and Casimir Pyrame de Candolle contributed to the Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis, a catalog of plants begun by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle.",

      A scientific name.
      CoL deals and categorizes the following types of names:

       - Linnaean names, i.e. mono-, bi- or trinomials
         - available or unavailable
       - Named hybrids and nothotaxa
       - Virus names

      A name includes it's authorship. Two homonyms with different authors therefore represent two different name entities.

      ### Lexical variations

      The same name can usually be represented by many different strings which we refer to as lexical variations.
      For each name a standard representation, the canonical form, exists.

      Lexical variations exist for various reasons.
      Author spelling, transliterations, epither gender, additional infrageneric or infraspecific indications, cited species authors in infraspecific names are common reasons.
      Listed here are 7 distinct names with some of their string representations:

      ```
       1. Aus bus Linnaeus 1758
          - Aus bus Linn. 1758
          - Aus bus Linn 1758
          - Aus bus L.
          - Aus ba Linn 1758.
          - Aus (Hus) bus L.

       2. Xus bus (Linn, 1758)
          - Xus bus (Linn) Smith

       3. Xus cus Smith, 1850
          - Xus cus Sm.

       4. Xus cus Jones 1900

       5. Xus bus cus Smith 1850
          - Xus bus subsp. cus Smith 1850

       6. Xus dus Pyle 2000

       7. Foo bar var. lion Smith 1850
          - Foo bar L. var. lion Smith
          - Foo bar subsp. dar var. lion Smith 1850
          - Foo bar Lin. subsp. dar Mill. var. lion Smith 1850
      ```

      New names (**sp./gen. nov.**),
      new recombinations of the same epithet (**comb. nov.**),
      a name at a new rank (**stat. nov.**)
      or replacement names (**nom. nov.**) are all treated as distinct names.

      ### Homotypic group & original name
      Names based on the same type can be clustered together as a homotypic group of names.
      A homotypic group not only includes all subsequent recombinations, but also any [replacement name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomen_novum) if existing.
      These names are homotypic synonyms, also called nomenclatural or objective synonyms.

      The first, originally published name is used to represent such a group as it is a clean proxy to the type specimen,
      therefore every name in a homotypic group points back to the same original name.

      Protonym in zoology and basionym in botany are terms for a very similar concept, but they do not include replacement names and are rather code specific
      so we will refer to *original name* here instead, inline with Darwin Core terminology.
      Original names are not necessarily Code-compliant original descriptions, but usually they are.

      The above names can be clustered into four sets of homotypic synonym groups, shown with canonical authorship:

      ```
       1. Aus bus Linnaeus 1758
          - Aus ba Linnaeus 1758 [orthographic variant]
          - Xus bus (Linnaeus 1758) Smith 1850 [alternate combination]

       2. Xus cus Smith 1850
          - Xus bus subsp. cus Smith 1850 [alternate rank]

       3. Xus cus Jones 1900 (heterotypic homonym of Xus cus Smith 1850)
          - Xus dus Pyle 2000 [replacement name for Xus cus Jones]

       4. Foo bar var. lion Smith 1850
      ```

      ### comb. nov. in ICZN vs ICN

      One of the most notable differences between [ICN](http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/)
      and [ICZN](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/) is the way names are cited when a species is placed in a different genus from the one it was originally published in (a comb. nov.).
      Botanists have a convention of always citing the authors of the original combination in brackets followed by the names of the authors of the combination.
      Zoologists don't follow this convention, they simply place the author of the original combination in brackets for the new combination and don't cite the authors who were first to make the new combination.
      This difference is cosmetic. Indeed [ICZN Recommendation 51G](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?article=51) is that new combinations in zoology should be quoted in a similar way to the way they are quoted in botany.

      *Basionym* is a well established term in the ICN where it is defined that
      a "basionym provides the final epithet, name, or stem of the new combination or name at new rank" (ICN Art. 6.10 & Art. 41).
      It is the orginal combination of a name as viewed from a new combination. The basionym is therefore always relative to a new combination.
      A name can't be a basionym in its own right only relative to another name.
      ICZN does not mention the term basionym but the notion is clearly present in zoological nomenclature as zoologists also have the concept of the new recombination of a name.

      A reference can be linked to a serial, e.g. a journal, that defines the content for the CSL container attributes.

      Treatments are the section of a publication that deals with a single scientific name.
      They are a unit of citation below articles. [Plazi](http://www.plazi.org) is based on them
      and Taxon Name Usages (TNU) in [GNUB](http://globalnames.org/docs/gnub/) correspond to treatments.

      The ability to link to the treatment of a name is very useful. It is accomplished in the NomenclaturalAct class,
      but not dealt with on the shared Reference instances.

        A journal or other serial used as a container for references.

        A serial is a publication in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts,
        usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.
        Serial publications include print periodicals and newspapers, electronic magazines and journals, annuals (reports, yearbooks, etc.),
        proceedings and transactions, and numbered monographic series cataloged separately.

        When serials split, merge, or are absorbed, a title change may occur.

        A specific serial title is identified by a unique International Standard Serials Number (ISSN) and key title,
        assigned and maintained by the International Serials Data System (ISDS), a network of national serials data centers.
        Serials and annuals are listed in Ulrich's International Periodicals Directory published annually by ProQuest and in The Serials Directory published by EBSCO.
